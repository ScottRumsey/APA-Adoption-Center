How to use the app:
When you open the app the first screen that will open will be the home screen. 
There you will have the options of searching for dogs or cats available by tapping
the appropriate button. After you make your decision and tap on the appropriate
button, the app will display a populated list of the available cats/dogs. It may take
a few seconds for the pictures to be displayed. You can scroll through the pictures,
and once you've found a dog/cat that you like you can tap on their picture to display
their information.  When you tap on the picture of a dog/cat the app will display
the animal's name sex, breed, weight, size, date of birth, age, color, if it is 
spayed/neutered, and the animal's adoption fee.  You can press back at any of the
app's screens to take you to the previous page.
